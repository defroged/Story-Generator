                In the year 2050, there was a great soccer player in Japan. His name was Ken. Ken was a small player, but he was very fast. He had a big dream. He wanted to win the big game for his team. One day, Ken trained very hard. He kicked the ball and ran fast. He wanted to be the best. But one day, his team had a problem. Their star player was sick and could not play. The team was empty without him. Ken felt sad. He thought, "Can I help my team?" On the day of the game, Ken felt nervous. He looked at the big crowd. They all wanted his team to win. He took a deep breath and remembered his training. The game started, and Ken ran fast. He passed the ball. He kicked the ball to score a goal! In the end, Ken's team won the game. The crowd cheered. Ken was very happy. His dream came true. He showed that a small player can do great things!
